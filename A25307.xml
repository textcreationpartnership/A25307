            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>SINCE my laſt ſeveral Ships are returned from Major General <hi>Kirk,</hi> who gives this Account, That Major General <hi>Kirk</hi> had Joyned his Grace the Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> with Fourteen Troops of Horſe, three of Dragoons, and Horſe for three or four Troops more; and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces are Battering <hi>Carrickfergus</hi> with Eight Men of War by Sea, and likewiſe by Land, and 'tis not doubted but they will ſoon be Maſters of it.</p>
            <p>Major <hi>Tiffen,</hi> after the great Defeat near <hi>Inniskilling,</hi> march'd towards Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Sarsfield</hi> with one Troop of Horſe, one of Dragoons, and two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panys of Foot; but finding him Decampt, and hearing he fled toward <hi>Sligo,</hi> marched after him thither; but when he came he found a clear Stage, the Enemy being fled, and left behind them Fourteen Pieces of Cannon in the Town, of which the ſaid Major is now in Poſſeſſion, and is Fortifying of that Place.</p>
            <p>Yeſterday at Noon ſailed from <hi>High-Lake</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Regiment of Horſe-Guards, commanded by the Right Honourable Colonel <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe. This day the Duke of <hi>Bolton</hi>'s Regiment of Foot ſet Sail from <hi>High-Lake,</hi> and—<hi>Herbert</hi>'s Troop goes from hence this day to the ſame place. Two Troops of Colonel <hi>Villar</hi>'s
<pb facs="tcp:96015:2"/>Regiment of Horſe are come in, and the reſt will follow this day, in order to their imbarking for <hi>Ireland</hi> with the firſt fair Wind. We likewiſe hear from <hi>Dublin,</hi> by a Ship come into <hi>Beaumaris,</hi> laden with Hides, Tallow, and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherein were ſeveral Paſſengers, as Mr. <hi>Berton,</hi> Servant to Alderman <hi>Fletcher</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smallman,</hi> Linnen-Drapers, with Monſieur <hi>La Rue,</hi> Silk-Man, who gives this Account, That King <hi>James</hi> had formed a Camp at <hi>Rathmine,</hi> on the South ſide of <hi>Dublin,</hi> compoſed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 7000 Foot, being all new-rais'd Men, that they had neither Shirts nor Shoes, for the moſt part, and a great Multitude of Women and Children that followed them; and that King <hi>James</hi> had given Orders to all the Pariſh-Prieſts, to take an Account of all Perſons from Sixteen to Sixty, and the place of their Abode, that they may be liſted in that Kings Service; and that upon the News of Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s landing, the Camp was ordered to march on the North ſide of the Town, intending to form an Army to go and fight him; but the Horſe that return'd from <hi>Derry,</hi> as well as the Foot, were miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Haraſs'd; and a <hi>French</hi> Officer that was in the Engagement before <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niskilling,</hi> ſaith, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> behaved themſelves to a Wonder, but he never ſaw ſuch Cowards as the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> ſome of them running Sixteen or Eighteen Miles without ſtaying to look behind them; inſomuch that King <hi>James</hi> was ſo enraged that he cauſed a Captain and a Corporal to be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for running away, for Example ſake: he alſo gives Account of a Ship arrived from <hi>France,</hi> with a <hi>French</hi> General and Twenty Officers, with ſome Arms, and that they had ſecured moſt of the conſiderable Proteſtants in the Weſt, not daring to truſt them, and are forming a Camp near <hi>Kinſale,</hi> as fearing the Earl of <hi>Torington</hi> may Land there, being now in deſpair of the <hi>French</hi> Succours; and that they have laid up a great Magazine in <hi>Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loane,</hi> and Fortified <hi>Gallway</hi> for a ſafe Retreat: But we hope the Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Renowned General <hi>Schomberg</hi> will ſoon cool their Courage, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as we hear taken the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Carrickfergus</hi> by Storm; ſo that he will be at liberty to march towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> having receiv'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe, who already forage up as far as the <hi>Newry</hi> and <hi>Charlemont.</hi> In our next we expect to hear of ſome Conſiderable Action, in the mean time I am your Humble Servant.</p>
